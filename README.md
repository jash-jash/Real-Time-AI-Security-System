# 🛡️ Real-Time AI Security System  

An AI-powered real-time security system that detects **faces, objects, and unauthorized access** using **YOLOv8 + DeepFace**.  
When an intruder or unknown object is detected, the system raises an **alarm** and records video evidence automatically.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Real-time face recognition (authorized vs unauthorized)  
- 🎯 Object detection with YOLOv8  
- 📹 Automatic recording of intrusions (saved in `recordings/`)  
- 🔔 Instant alarm sound for alerts  
- 🗂️ Supports multiple authorized users

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- DeepFace (Face Recognition)  
- OpenCV

## ⚙️ System Design
The high-level pipeline for the Real-Time AI Security System:

![Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

- Camera → Frame capture/preprocess  
- YOLOv8 for object detection  
- Face detection → DeepFace recognition vs. authorized whitelist  
- Decision engine triggers: **alarm**, **recording**, **logging**

## Authorized Faces Setup

This project requires images of authorized persons for the face recognition system.  
⚠️ For privacy and security reasons, these images are **not included** in the repository.

To set it up:
1. Go to the folder: `data/authorized_faces/`
2. Create a subfolder for each authorized person (e.g., `person1`, `person2`)
3. Place 10–20 clear face images of each person in their respective folder  
   - Use `.jpg` or `.png`
   - Include multiple angles/lighting conditions

Example structure:
data/
└── authorized_faces/
├── person1/
│ ├── img1.jpg
│ ├── img2.jpg
└── person2/
├── img1.png
├── img2.png
